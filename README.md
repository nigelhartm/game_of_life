# game_of_life
Here a simple implementation project in that i builded game of life with a gui implementation in java.

## Rules
Basically the rules are adapted from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life<br>
Anyway I used the following rule based on number of direct alive neighbors:<br>
<br>
dead = 0;<br>
alive = 1;<br>
will die = 2;<br>
will be born = 3;<br>
